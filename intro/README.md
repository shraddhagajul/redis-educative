## Redis 
Redis stands for REmote DIctionary Server. It is a NoSQL advanced key-value data store. The read and write operations are very fast in Redis because it stores all data in memory. The data can also be stored on the disk and can be written back to the memory.

It is often referred to as a data structure server because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs.

NoSQL means Not only SQL. The NoSQL databases don't define database structures like tables, nor do they support queries, such as SQL SELECT. The data is mostly stored as JSON objects or key-value pairs.

Since Redis stores its data in memory, it is most commonly used as a cache.
